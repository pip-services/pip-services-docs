# What is Pip.Services toolkit? 

> Pip.Services Toolkit speeds up development of production-grade microservices for various cloud and on-premises platforms in the language of your choice. Symmetric implementation of structures and patterns across all supported languages and out-of-the-box interoperability simplify development in polyglot environments. The toolkit design based on composition allows to mix it with other frameworks and libraries. 

## What can you do with Pip.Services toolkit?

> * Speed up your microservice development by using prebuilt patterns and components.
> * Use the toolkit by itself or in conjunction with other frameworks and libraries.
> * Get out-of-the-box interoperability in Node.js, .Net, Golang, Dart, Python, Java.
> * Build production-grade microservices with instrumentation and health monitoring.
> * Run microservices as processes, Docker containers, Services Fabric or Serverless.
> * Deploy microservices on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or on-premises.
> * Support multiple platforms and switch between them without touching the code.
> * Innovate with ease by adding new technologies into existing microservices.
