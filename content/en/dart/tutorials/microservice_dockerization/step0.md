Before we can start writing-up some microservices, we’ll need to install a few mandatory prerequisites.


### 1.Docker, Docker Composer and Powershell
To install Docker, download the Docker Desktop installer that corresponds to the operating system you’re using from the official Docker site https://www.docker.com/get-started. Once downloaded, launch the installer and follow the installation instructions.

Once installed, check that the installation was completed successfully by running the following commands from your console:

```bash
docker --version
```

If everything was installed successfully, the screen will display the latest version of Docker.

Now, we need to install Docker Compose. To do this, follow the instructions given [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Lastly, we need to install Powershell. The instructions to install this tool are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) 

Now that we’ve got the environment all set up, we can move on to [Step 2. Setting up the project.](../step2)
