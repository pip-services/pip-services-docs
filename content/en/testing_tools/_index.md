### [Benchmarking Framework](benchmarks)
Performance, resilience and data integrity are a priority in microservice development. To make your life easier, we implemented a benchmarking framework to keep critical non-functional characteristics under constant control.  In a similar vein with Pip.Service Toolkit, the framework has symmetrical implementations to make it easier to switch between programming languages.
