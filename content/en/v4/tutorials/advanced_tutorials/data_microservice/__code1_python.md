For working with the Python programming language, you'll need to perform its installation and setup the environment. To do this, download and install Python from their official site (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Select the download that corresponds to the operating system you're using, and follow the installation instructions listed on their site.

Once installed, check that the installation was completed successfully by running the following command from your console:

```bash
python --version
```
